We have on-site childcare available for the main conference days on November 10 and 11th for attendees. 

Improv Care will be providing the service for us this year and they've asked that all parents fill in a form for each child.

Many thanks to Freshbooks for sponsoring this year's childcare. 

The form is available here:
