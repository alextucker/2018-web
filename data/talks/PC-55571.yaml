talk_abstract: "Quantum computing is an exciting scientific field that is coming out of the lab to the real world (e.g. IBM, Google). Let's dive into basics of quantum computing and overview the tools that are available in Python. By the end of the talk, you will use them to program a quantum computer yourself."

talk_details: |
  The paradigm of quantum computing might be just 2-3 years away from having practical relevance for certain applications. However, the ability to solve problems on these devices is still relatively scarce. In this talk, we will overview the main quantum computing paradigms and demonstrate how to solve problems on these devices with Python. We cover multiple players in the field (IBM, Google, Rigetti, D-Wave,..) and help the audience to navigate rather complex landscape of quantum computing in Python.

  The talk is self-contained. The attendees of this talk do not need to have any background knowledge in physics or quantum computing prior to the talk. "

about_author: |
  Tomas is a co-founder of ProteinQure, a quantum computing startup based in Toronto, Canada. Founded in 2017, ProteinQure focuses on computational (in-silico) drug design of protein based drugs. Prior to founding ProteinQure, Tomas worked for European Space Agency and Red Hat. He holds a MSc in Computer Science from Masaryk University, focusing on machine learning, cybersecurity and quantum computing, with a thesis on using quantum annealers to enhance probabilistic inference in graphical models.

  Python is Tomasâ€™ language of choice for more than 10 years, and he maintains and contributes to several Python-based open source projects. Recently he co-authored a survey on open source tools in the quantum computing space (currently in review).
