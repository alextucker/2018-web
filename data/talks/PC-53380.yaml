talk_details: |
  In this workshop, we'll discuss the fundamental structure of programming and music with the use of Python. 
  Python is a widely-used, and human readable programming language that allows users to quickly write code and solve problems. 
  We'll discuss the structure and rules of music:

  * Basic Music Theory and Notes
  * The Major Scale
  * The Minor Scale
  * Chords

  We'll take all of these concepts, and using the power of Python, re-create a famous pop song using only our computer! 
  This talk is great for understanding the following concepts in Python:

  * Basic types
  * Classes  with an OOP paradigm
  * Data Structures
  * Control Flow
