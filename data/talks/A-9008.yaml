talk_details: |
  FreshBooks sends over a million emails every year. And no, I’m not talking about marketing emails telling you about 
  some exciting new email we’ve just released. I’m talking about transactional emails. When you sign up and verify your account, 
  we send an email. When you send an invoice to your clients, that’s an email. When you you want to reset your password, 
  that’s an email. Email is not only a critical part of FreshBooks, but of our customers. How can clients pay their invoices, 
  if they don’t receive them? In this talk, I’ll be going over how FreshBooks built dependability, reliability, and resilience 
  into our email infrastructure, so that we can guarantee that our emails are delivered."
