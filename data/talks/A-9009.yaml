talk_abstract: "Have you ever seen a dog and wanted to know what breed it was? In this tutorial, you will learn how to train an image classification model using 
  transfer learning."

talk_details: |

  The Azure Machine Learning SDK's PyTorch estimator enables you to easily submit PyTorch training jobs for 
  both single-node and distributed runs on Azure compute. The model is trained to classify dog breeds first using a pretrained 
  ResNet model that has been trained on the [Stanford Dog dataset](https://na01.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fvision.stanford.edu%2Faditya86%2FImageNetDogs%2F&data=02%7C01%7Ca-pavuon%40microsoft.com%7Cc968724834db4a5e761408d63a9b9dd8%7C72f988bf86f141af91ab2d7cd011db47%7C1%7C0%7C636760837538486038&sdata=eRna7uU4aoThNdRTmQafw90pXvYop%2FPNNvQO%2BAR6ae4%3D&reserved=0).
