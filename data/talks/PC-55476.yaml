talk_details: |

  In this talk I will show how I turned my raspberry pi into a home security system. 
  I will start with going over the different options for home security with a raspberry pi, 
  then go into detail about the method I chose, which uses a video feed, OpenCV, and background subtraction 
  to detect motion. I will then show how you can layer on out of the box image classification algorithms to 
  reduce the number of false positives, and show how slack can be used as a notifications system and GUI to 
  control your system. While the talk will focus on home security systems with the raspberry pi, the technologies 
  and methods used will highlight the potential for many other use cases. I will finish off with some lessons learned 
  and other applications of these technologies.

about_author: |
  As a student of Chemical Engineering at Queen's University, Ian was pursuing a career back home in Calgary 
  in the Oil & Gas industry. During one summer, he was thrown into the world of data science when he started 
  trying to make money by using Python to optimize daily fantasy sports lineups. After the oil price started 
  crashing, he realized he should probably look for work in another industry.

  With a new found passion for data science, Ian started working for Capital One in Toronto as a data scientist. 
  For the past two years, he has been working on operational monitoring across the business, credit risk analysis, 
  data infrastructure & risk models. In his spare time, Ian likes to participate in hackathons, work on side projects 
  (usually involving a raspberry pi), or eat burrito boyz.
